# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Leaderboard

This is a terminal-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Python. It supports two players, keeps track of wins, losses, and draws using a leaderboard stored in a JSON file. You can also print or clear the leaderboard through the available commands.

## Game Rules

1. **Win:** A player wins by aligning three of their symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2. **Draw:** The game is declared a draw if the board is full without any winner.
3. **Leaderboard Updates:**
   - Winnerâ€™s win counter (`w`) increments.
   - Loserâ€™s loss counter (`l`) increments.
   - If the game is a draw, both players' draw counter (`d`) increments.
